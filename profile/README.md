## Welcome to Fantasy League ðŸ‘‹

### What is FL.GG
Fantasy League is an online trading platform where, the performance of LOL players on the ranked ladder is directly tied to an underlying security in the form of a trading card.

### How it Works?
These cards have the ability to be publicly traded in the online auction house or acquired through random card packs, with a higher overall being tied to increasing rarity.

### Purpose?
Users have the opportunity to build their dream teams with the acquired cards, play in online tournaments, and compete for a spot in top leagues utilizing win/loss record.

### Impact?
The benefit of this project is that putting something at stake, other than league points, such as your online player rating, gives players a sense of importance and this will hopefully reduce trolling, inting, and tilting. (lower rank = lower rating = less demand).
